Required
🎯 What requirements did you achieve?
🎯 Were there any requirements or goals that you were unable to achieve?
🎯 If so, what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?

i achived the responsive design and media queries, alt text for the accessibility, interactive image switching and i hope the aira attributes.

i touched on the tab indexing but could have done more.

didnt attempt the srcset for device loading or optimisation i got too focused on what i wanted the end product to 
look like and by the time i got to that stretch goal i had 7 image assets. If i can get to it on the weekend this will be somthing i aim to complete.

I think if i added more advanced aria attributes such as aria-label on interactive elements it could improve accessibility further.

the javascript wasnt too bad the sudo code really helped with that.

i had difficulty with debugging the css for repsonisve behaviour, particularly ensuring that the gallery maintained a usable layout on very small screens, once i found a sulotion though it seemed ovbious.
